# COMP-1510-Term-Project-Rewrite

# An excuse for the messy GitHub pushes

Sorry I worked on the train a lot without Wi-Fi and would often get a lot done without being able to push.
I just recently figured out that I can commit the change and then push later so whoops.
I'm pretty sure you'll still dock marks but this is my reason.

# A PSA for Chris:

The "glitchy" look of using the "rewrite" action is intentional.
the fact that it obscures your vision and flips text is also intentional.
I wanted to increase the difficulty of the game and add to
the "meddling with forces beyond your imagining" feel of the game, without adding unnecessary complexity.
